/*
 * Programming Quiz: Build A Triangle (5-3)
 */

/*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * - Your code should have a `buildTriangle()` function
 * - Your `buildTriangle()` function should take one argument (or you can say parameter)
 * - Your `laugh()` function should build the triangle as describe above
 */


// creates a line of * for a given length
function makeLine(length) {
    var line = "";
    for (var j = 1; j <= length; j++) {
        line += "* ";
    }
    return line + "\n";
}

// your code goes here.  Make sure you call makeLine() in your own code.
function buildTriangle(length) {
    // Let's build a huge string equivalent to the triangle
    var triangle = "";

    //Let's start from the topmost line
    var lineNumber = 1;

    for (lineNumber = 1; lineNumber <= length; lineNumber++) {
        // We will not print one line at a time.
        // Rather, we will make a huge string that will comprise the whole triangle
        triangle = triangle + makeLine(lineNumber);
    }
    return triangle;
}

// test your code by uncommenting the following line
console.log(buildTriangle(10));
